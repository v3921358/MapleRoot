This is NOT intended to be a PURE v83 MapleStory server emulator (acting
under the clean WZ files, provided by Nexon/Wizet). There has been provided
a whole array of edited WZ on the Drive to be used for this server. Although
normal WZs will load properly, there is no guarantee in-game bugs and issues
may arise because of some incompatibilities with the clean files.
